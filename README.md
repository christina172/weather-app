# weather-app
Weather App Project (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path, JavaScript Course, Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs)

This is my Weather App that shows current weather in a city. The color of the heading (of the search result) with the name of the city and the temperature matches the color of the section in the page heading with the corresponding range.
The app displays the weather data along with the weather icon. The data is fetched from weatherapi.com. There is also a button to toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
The app also has responsive design.
